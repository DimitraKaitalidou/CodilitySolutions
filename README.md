# CodilitySolutions
This repository contains my solutions to the [Lessons of Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/). All solutions achieved 100% score in both correctness and performance.

1. Iterations
   - BinaryGap: Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer
   
2. Arrays
   - CyclicRotation: Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps
   - OddOccurrencesInArray: Find value that occurs in odd number of elements

3. Time Complexity
   - FrogJmp: Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y
   - PermMissingElem: Find the missing element in a given permutation
   - TapeEquilibrium: Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|

4. Counting Elements
   - FrogRiverOne: Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river
   - MaxCounters: Calculate the values of counters after applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; set value of all counters to current maximum
   - MissingInteger: Find the smallest positive integer that does not occur in a given sequence
   - PermCheck: Check whether array A is a permutation

5. Prefix Sums
   - CountDiv: Compute number of integers divisible by k in range [a..b]
   - GenomicRangeQuery: Find the minimal nucleotide from a range of sequence DNA
   - MinAvgTwoSlice: Find the minimal average of any slice containing at least two elements
   - PassingCars: Count the number of passing cars on the road 

6. Sorting
   - Distinct: Compute number of distinct values in an array
   - MaxProductOfThree: Maximize A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] for any triplet (P, Q, R)
   - NumberOfDiscIntersections: Compute the number of intersections in a sequence of discs
   - Triangle: Determine whether a triangle can be built from a given set of edges

7. Stacks and Queues
   - Brackets: Determine whether a given string of parentheses (multiple types) is properly nested
