# CodilitySolutions
This repository contains my solutions to the [Lessons of Codility](https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/).

1. Iterations
   - BinaryGap: Find longest sequence of zeros in binary representation of an integer
   
2. Arrays
   - CyclicRotation: Rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps

3. Time Complexity
   - FrogJmp: Count minimal number of jumps from position X to Y
   - TapeEquilibrium: Minimize the value |(A[0] + ... + A[P-1]) - (A[P] + ... + A[N-1])|

4. Counting Elements
   - FrogRiverOne: Find the earliest time when a frog can jump to the other side of a river
   - MaxCounters: Calculate the values of counters after applying all alternating operations: increase counter by 1; set value of all counters to current maximum
   - MissingInteger: Find the smallest positive integer that does not occur in a given sequence

5. Prefix Sums
   - PassingCars: Count the number of passing cars on the road 

6. Sorting
   - Distinct: Compute number of distinct values in an array
   - MaxProductOfThree: Maximize A[P] * A[Q] * A[R] for any triplet (P, Q, R)
